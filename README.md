# Scikit-Learn House Prices Prediction

**Goal:** The goal is simple: build a predictive model that accurately estimates home sale prices in Ames, Iowa by uncovering hidden patterns in the dataset. You'll need to analyze all 79 features—from obvious factors like square footage to subtle influences like neighborhood zoning—and engineer the best approach to beat the competition. The most accurate predictions win.

**Dataset:** Ames Housing dataset (train.csv). Contains 79 explanatory features describing residential homes and the target variable Sale Price.

Predict sale prices of Ames, Iowa homes with scikit-learn pipelines, feature engineering, and RMSLE-optimized models.
